A user clicks on a URL, and due to slow internet connection/inadequate website optimization/heavy website content/any other reason, the web page takes a while to load.

Given that Selenium is the most popular automated testing framework in global usage, this article will explore how QAs can use Selenium to wait for a page to load during an automated test.
